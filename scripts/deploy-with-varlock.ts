/**
 * The production deploy runs under the deploy-agent role: every venue that
 * deploys supplies its own 1Password identity under
 * DEPLOY_AGENT_PRODUCTION_OP_TOKEN. The self-hosted GitHub Actions runner
 * injects the GitHub deploy agent's token as a repository secret — the
 * preferred path, identical to the Workers repos. When no identity is present
 * this is a supervised operator run, so the script re-execs itself under
 * `op run`, resolving the Mac Mini identity through 1Password desktop
 * authorization.
 *
 * Delivery is Docker Compose rather than a Worker upload: the schema is
 * resolved into the process environment and Compose interpolates `${VAR}` from
 * there. No `--env-file` and no generated plaintext env file is involved
 * anywhere in this path.
 *
 * Runtime steps run under `varlock run`. The image build cannot, because
 * `varlock run` strips @internal items and the build needs the install token —
 * so it gets an explicitly constructed environment instead.
